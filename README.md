# Phasor Measurement Unit


## Objective

Build a two-phase measurement unit. Such a unit is used to measure the voltage, frequency, phase and current of an AC source. The data obtained from such a unit is used during the events of power outage or failures by analyzing any faults seen in through the PMU. The system consists of four major subsystems, rectifier, phase-locked loop, data collector and user interface.
